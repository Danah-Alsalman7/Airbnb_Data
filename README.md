# Airbnb Data
## Airbnb Listings & Reviews Dataset: <hr>
This dataset contains information about Airbnb listings, including property details, host information, pricing, availability, and guest reviews. It comprises data for 250,000+ listings in 10 major cities, along with over 5 million historical reviews.

We create a sample of the data after merging the two data sets because there are a lot of rows in the data. By addressing the missing values and verifying the duplicate values, we sanitize the data.

We offer some helpful charts and charts showing the relationship between two columns based on the exploratory data analysis (EDA), and we observed that the Price Distribution: The right-skewed distribution of listing prices indicates that there are fewer listings with higher prices and that most listings have lower values. This suggests that Airbnb offers a range of accommodation choices to accommodate different budgets. Host Response Rate: A considerable proportion of hosts exhibit a commitment to promptly responding to guest inquiries, as substantiated by their elevated response rates. This attention to detail is likely going to improve both the overall booking experience and guest happiness.

We advise hosts to carefully consider their pricing strategy, accounting for factors such as property type, location, and amenities offered in price management. This can help optimize listing prices to bring in new clients and keep a competitive advantage in the industry. and split the data into multiple smaller rows to facilitate a deeper analysis and comprehension of the material.
